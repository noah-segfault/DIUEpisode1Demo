Syre really just came to me one day. 
I didn’t know what I was going to call the album, but one day it really really came. 
I don’t know what happened. It was like a switch—from one second to another, my whole life switched. 
I realized that Syre was the answer, what I had to move forward with. 
People love to just talk about me by name and say, "Oh, Jaden Smith this, Jaden Smith that." 
It’s time for a new awakening and a new consciousness. Anybody who thinks they know me, this album is something completely different from what they think.

Erys picks up where Jaden left off with the conclusion of Syre the story of a boy who is obsessed with chasing the sunset and until one day it chased him, and it ends up killing him. 
Erys is a now resurrected part of Syre. 
The album revolves around Erys and portrays him as a boy whose ego has gotten the best of him. 
During the album he’s portrayed as an ill-mannered person who some might say is the exact opposite of Syre.

Erys is Jaden's third full length album and was released on July 5, 2019. 
The title is a reference to a hypebeast character Jaden created for the lore behind his debut album Syre

For me there's no portion of lying, absorbed in the nightfall.
Let bygones be bygones
So I crawl home with no shoulder to cry on
No crushing, no houses to send flowers
Syre cried a floral river into the valley where the sun set for hours

The first four tracks on Jaden's Syre will forever mark an epic intro. 
The smooth transitions between all of them slaps hard.
